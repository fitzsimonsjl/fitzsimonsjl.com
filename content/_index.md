This is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) site hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). There's no styling because I dislike fighting with CSS. 

This site is not optimised for SEO in any way because I'm not expecting much of an audience. If you're reading this then it's likely that:

- You've got a copy of my CV and followed the link from there
- You already know the URL to access it 
- You've stumbled across it by accident

The site doesn't contain any tracking pixels, analytics, sign-up forms, or newsletter links because I feel like it would be hypocritical to do so whilst writing about privacy and security.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

On this site you'll find my ramblings on tech, privacy, OSINT, and cybersecurity - see the "Blog" section. At some point I'll get around to adding a Photography section (it'll probably be a while)

I have no plans to allow comments on posts because I'd rather not spend time moderating them. 

If you want to get in touch with me about anything written here (whether it's to tell me you liked it and want to discuss it further, have a question, or because you want to argue with me and tell me I'm wrong), you can send an email to <jackfitzsimons@tutanota.com>.
