Here you can find my ramblings on tech, privacy, OSINT, and cybersecurity - see the "Blog" section. I'm gradually updating the Photography section - feel free to take a gander if that's your sort of thing.

I have no plans to allow comments on posts because I'd rather not spend time moderating them. If you want to get in touch with me about anything written here (whether it's to tell me you liked it and want to discuss it further, have a question, or because you want to argue with me and tell me I'm wrong), you can send an email to <jackfitzsimons@tutanota.com>

This site is not optimised for SEO because I'm not expecting much of an audience. It does not contain any JavaScript,tracking pixels, analytics, sign-up forms, or newsletter links - I feel like it would be hypocritical to include any of these things whilst writing about privacy and security.
