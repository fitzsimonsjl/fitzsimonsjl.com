This is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) site hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). There's no styling because I dislike fighting with CSS. 

This site is not optimised for SEO in any way because I'm not expecting much of an audience. It has very little styling because I dislike fighting with CSS. It does not contain any tracking pixels, analytics, sign-up forms, or newsletter links because I feel like it would be hypocritical to do so whilst writing about privacy and security.

Here you can find my ramblings on tech, privacy, OSINT, and cybersecurity - see the "Blog" section. I'm gradually updating the Photography section - feel free to take a gander if that's your sort of thing.

I have no plans to allow comments on posts because I'd rather not spend time moderating them. If you want to get in touch with me about anything written here (whether it's to tell me you liked it and want to discuss it further, have a question, or because you want to argue with me and tell me I'm wrong), you can send an email to <jackfitzsimons@tutanota.com>
