This site is a static site hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com), using the [Hugo Static Site Generator](https://gohugo.io). It doesn't have much styling because I'd rather not fight with CSS. 

This site is not optimised for SEO in any way because I'm not expecting much of an audience. If you're reading this then it's likely that:

- You've got a copy of my CV and followed the link from there
- You already know the URL to access it 
- You've stumbled across it by accident

The site doesn't contain any tracking pixels, analytics, sign-up forms, or newsletter links because I feel like it would be hypocritical to do so whilst writing about privacy and security.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

On this site you'll find my ramblings on tech, privacy, OSINT, and cybersecurity - see the "Blog" section. 

Occasionally you might also find a cat picture or two. If you're looking for non-cat pictures, head over to the "Photography" section, which I'll someday get to updating.

I have no plans to allow comments on posts because I'd rather not spend time moderating them. If you want to get in touch with me about anything written here (whether it's to tell me you liked it and want to discuss it further, have a question, or because you want to argue with me and tell me I'm wrong), feel free to drop me an email at <jackfitzsimons@tutanota.com> 

I'm not really one for social media, but if you want to stalk me for whatever reason, you can find me on:

[LinkedIn](https://dk.linkedin.com/in/jacklukefitzsimons)

[Mastodon](https://infosec.exchange/@jfitzsimo)

If you'd like to see what I've been working on in my free time, you can take a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/fitzsimonsjl).
