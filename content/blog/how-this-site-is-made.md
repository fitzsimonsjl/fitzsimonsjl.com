## What exactly is a Static Site Generator (SSG)?
A Static Site Generator takes content you give it (text, images and so on) and builds this all as standard HTML. What this means is that the content does not change and is shown to the user exactly the same way every single time.

For websites that are primarily text based (such as blogs), this can be useful. It means that the site is quick to load for visitors, quick to develop/build, and very easy to maintain. All you need to really do is provide the text.

## Choosing an SSG

Static Site Generators are hardly a new concept - the most popular ones have been around for roughly 10 years or more and have become far more refined with added functionalties over the years. 

When deciding on which I was planning to use, the three that I considered (which are probably the most well known) were Jekyll, Gatsby, and Hugo.
