They promise to help us sleep better, to remind us to exercise, give us targets to hit on our next run, or swim, or bike ride. They collect everything from heart rate to workout length, tracking your workout route. There's no doubt they're excellent for athletes and non-athletes alike (even if it just serves as good motivation to get your workout in at the gym so you don't break your "rings" streak on your Apple Watch), but where exactly is all this data we're giving them going?...
